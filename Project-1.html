            <p>
                This project originally started as an automated greenhouse. I found that the original design was a bit too bulky,
                so I scaled it down and made this indoor version. The design is a pretty simple concept; A temperature/humidity sensor
                reads information inside the greenhouse. Based off the data send by the sensor, misters, a fan, & light levels can be adjusted.
                This in turn lets me not worry about what's growing inside as the process is automated. The logic component of the build
                is an Arduino Uno outside the greenhouse. This connects to the sensor, fan, misters, & some relays. I uploaded code
                to the Arduino to handle any logic that was needed. The code can be viewed on my Github.

            <p>
                I learned much through this project. Breaking it down into some categories, I learned the following:
                <br><br/><b>Embedded Programming</b><br/>
                While I'd tinkered with it before in classes & free-time, I've never tried writing embedded code to actually make something work.
                Utilizing the Arduino interface allowed me to do this fairly easily. The code itself is basically just C with some extra functions.
                I'm reasonably familiar with C, so this didn't prove too difficult.
                <br><br/><b>Circuits</b><br/>
                My experience with circuits is nearly non-existent. Fortunately, Arduino handles most things circuitry, unless it gets complex. While
                I didn't have the need to develop my own circuit, I did get to find out how relays work.
                <br><br/><b>Mushroom Research</b><br/>
                It's not necessarily important knowledge for this website, but I learned a ton about mushrooms & fungi during my build. My information
                came from a plethora of videos, documentaries, & other websites of fellow mushroom lovers. I don't feel I should put my findings here,
                but it was fun nevertheless. This influenced my design a bit, and I have ideas on how to refactor my greenhouse in the future.
