                    <b>Roles & Background</b><br>
                    Over the past 2 summers (2020-2021) I've interned at Hy-vee HST as a backend developer. During that time I've had the pleasure of working
                    with many full-stack developers. The team I'm on, Accounts-Payable, works primarily with data-syncing, tax automation, and API development.
                    In 2020, I got to try my hand in all these domains. As of 2021 however, there was a team reformation & I worked primarily with data-syncing
                    issues. This was mainly comprised of modifying old SQL stored-procedures and working with legacy apps.<br><br/><b>Duties</b><br/> As far as duties, I was expected to
                    attend daily standups, practice AGILE procedures, commit code to Git daily, & practice TDD (test-driven-development).

                <p>
                    Over the course of my internship I got the chance to work in many different tech-stacks. This allowed me to learn a wealth of new knowledge
                    which I like to categorize into 2 sections:
                    <br/><br/><b>Software/Programs</b><br> In the summer of 2020 I was able to learn a few new softwares. This includes:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JetBrains IDEs</li>
                        <li>Insomnia</li>
                        <li>Splunk</li>
                        <li>Parallels</li>
                        <li>Jira</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2021 I was able to learn even a few more softwares. This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>SSMS</li>
                        <li>SSMS Reports</li>
                        <li>Concourse Pipelines</li>
                        <li>Parallels</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br/><br/><b>Coding Languages</b><br>
                    As far as languages go it's a bit hard to count. I was exposed to many different languages, the most prevalent of those being (In order of expertise):
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Kotlin</li>
                        <li>C#</li>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                        <li>VB</li>
                        <li>GraphQL</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                     As I mentioned before, there were many other languages I was exposed to, however these 5 I feel most comfortable in.

                    <b>Work on Kotlin APIs</b><br>
                    Before my team split, I was able to do some work on the Kotlin API's our team owned. While I can't give out exact specifics of what the API's are,
                    they were mainly used for data management across stores. My work on these API's consisted of things like adding endpoints, changing business logic,
                    writing tests, and some gradle work. One of the more time consuming projects I worked on was converting the API's test framework from JUnit to Kotest.
                    The API's had thousands upon thousands of tests, so it was a cumbersome task. Through their conversion however, I did learn some optimization strategies
                    and much about the Kotest framework.
                    <br><br><b>Stored Procedure Work</b><br>
                    During my time at Hy-Vee, I've had to touch many things SQL. This ranges from simple things like creating a table index, all the way to creating new
                    stored procedures. Through my SQL work I've learned so much it's hard to recall everything. The most common things I worked on were generally simple changes.
                    Doing things like modifying procedure parameters or removing hard-coded data came frequently. There were a few instances where I got to write a new
                    stored procedure, or completely replace an old one. Those instances proved to be a bit more difficult, but came with greater learning outcomes.
                    <br><br><b>Other Work</b><br>
                    My team manages many tech-stacks, so there were numerous opportunities to work on different things. Among those things were Hyland work, Pipelining,
                    & SSMS Report Building. Hyland work consisted of working with C# scripts that interfaced with a 3rd party company. This was a bit tricky as Hyland
                    uses some oddly written string-matching system for passing along data. I got the chance to work with Concourse Pipelines - which is used as a deployment tool.
                    This let me get some experience with the YAML language as well as Concourse as a whole. Finally, I used SSMS Report builder to generate a few reports.
                    There was definitely a learning curve to the program, but once I figured it out it's basically just SQL with extra buttons.
