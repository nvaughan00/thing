                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Our team was tasked with building a fully autonomous smart greenhouse to grow various herbs & plants.<br/>
                    While no formal requirements were given for the project, our group decided on the following:<br/>
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aspects of the greenhouse must be automated</li>
                        <li>Features must be easily modifiable through a user interface</li>
                        <li>Design must accommodate multiple different herbs/plants</li>
                        <li>Project must cost under $1000 in total</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, our group has decided to design & build our own testbed for implementing this project.<br/>
                    The testbed will consist of a wooden greenhouse with dedicated spaces for sensors & growing equipment.<br/>
                    While the group does not currently have a design for this, we will be working on it in the coming weeks.

                <h3>Contributions/Roles</h3>
                <p>
                    As a group, we decided domains & areas of expertise to each member. My role in the group was AGILE leader<br/>
                    & backend developer. Currently, our group is still in the design phase, so my contributions are limited to<br/>
                    backend-wireframing, & AGILE related tasks. As our leader in AGILE, I'm responsible for:<br/>
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Creating & assigning tasks on a sprint board</li>
                        <li>Estimating workload through a point system each sprint</li>
                        <li>Keeping members on track with set deadlines</li>
                        <li>Managing our Gitlab repo</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                    At this time it's considered a stretch goal by the group, however I will also be implementing data logging into a<br/>
                    SQL table. This could eventually be used to track growth trends in plants throughout the greenhouse. More info to<br/>
                    come on this as the project progresses.

                <h3>Knowledge gain</h3>
                <p>
                    Although we still haven't implemented our project, I've still learned a good bit from these few weeks.<br>
                    Walking into the project I had the mindset of corporate work. During past internships I've had the environment<br>
                    was very established & professional. Not to say my group isn't professional, but the modular styling isn't quite<br>
                    there yet. This has caused me to realize I need to take a leadership role. Implementing a project planning<br>
                    style (like AGILE) will greatly increase our group's productivity. I've also learned a bit on how to present<br>
                    to a group in a way that will produce a desired outcome. For example, I created a sprint board to track our progress<br>
                    & presented it to the group. I did so in a way that was accessible & easy to learn for the group. Technical knowledge<br>
                    gain to come here....<br>
