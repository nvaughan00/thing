            <p>
                I made this project to help make piano practice fun for myself. The idea was to take a list of songs I wanted to learn, get a bunch of
                pdfs/screenshots of sheet music, and display the sheets in the order of the list. This way I could get a randomized practice rotation
                to spice things up a bit. I did this using a little bit of Java's JPanel, and some Kotlin classes. My inevitable goal was to port this
                desktop app over to an android app, however I found I'm not the biggest fan of Android Studio. My future plans for this have since shifted;
                I'd like to rewrite the app to be more modular. I'd also like to eventually display everything using my newfound HTML & Javascript skills.
                This could all be hosted on some budget server or something I spin up.

            <p>
                It was quite awhile ago when I wrote this desktop app, however I did learn a good bit from it. My learning outcomes were the following:
                <br><br/><b>Kotlin</b><br/>
                When starting this app I was completely new to Kotlin. I'd just come from a bunch of Java classes, so the syntax switch was a bit difficult.
                Once I was a few days in though, I found I absolutely love writing in Kotlin. The language is so fluid feeling, and it does so much for you
                that's a total pain in Java. I learned a lot about Kotlin's built in data-types, functions, & other special features. This project helped
                strength my Kotlin skills immensely.
                <br><br/><b>Git</b><br/>
                I was also fairly new to Git at the time of this app's creation. I'd just started using it for my internship, so I figured it'd be the perfect
                way to get to know Git. If I remember correctly, I ended up writing most the code locally. Looking back on this, I wish I used git more. As of
                now, I'm an expert in Git, so it ended up not being a terribly important deal.
                <br><br/><b>Android Studio</b><br/>
                This program was one of the least enjoyable things I've tried in awhile. I got fairly far into writing an app that would do the same as my desktop
                app, but the program was just too obnoxious. I found doing simple things were painful to implement. It may be the case that I didn't quite get over
                the learning curve required for the program. Regardless, I will most likely not be revisiting Android Studio any time in the near future.
