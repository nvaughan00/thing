                Building this website from scratch was a challenge to say the least. I figured html, css, & javascript wouldn't be so bad, however
                the learning curve was pretty rough. Once I figured out what divs are though, it became much easier. I originally thought of
                this idea because I'm currently enrolled in a user-interfaces class. The class deals with many of the same things I learned through
                the building of this website, so mission achieved. The entirety of this website was created this semester Fall (2020-2021), In about
                3 months. While there's still much I'd like to learn (especially on the javascript side), this was a good starting place. I wrote all
                my code through Jetbrains's Webstorm IDE, which made things a bit easier.

            <p>
                I'm very happy with the amount I've learned from building this website. I had no HTML, CSS, or Javascript experience before this, and
                I'd like to thing I'm fairly proficient in them now.
                <br><br/><b>HTML</b><br/>
                I learned the basics of HTML through this website. Topics like connecting pages, formatting, divs, lists, and images were all covered.
                I found the topic of divs especially interesting. It's quite fun to embed divs in other divs to create things. In my mind, it's very modular
                and clear how they interact. I also learned a bit about best practices when it comes to HTML and have tried to follow those. I built this website
                on borrowed time however, so those standards may not have been perfectly met.
                <br><br/><b>CSS</b><br/>
                Basically just a beast of formatting is what I took away from CSS. You can throw it on to defined classes that are made-up or HTML standard.
                Trying to format things before I knew what CSS was made the project much harder. After learning how CSS and HTML interact, I'm pretty confident
                in my design skills.
                <br><br/><b>Javascript</b><br/>
                To start, I wish I used more javascript in building this website. I ended up only using it for the rotating image thing on the home screen.
                There's so many useful functions with the language, and I definitely could've implemented them better. That being said, I did learn a good bit
                about the language through experimentation. I look forward to messing with javascript more in the future.
